### 🧾 Financial Modules
- **Accounts Receivable (AR):** Automatically tracks unpaid customer orders and calculates expected incoming cash.
- **Accounts Payable (AP):** Monitors business expenses and upcoming bills to manage shop overhead.
- **Cash Flow Analysis:** Provides a "Net Cash Position" to determine the business's current financial health.
### 🚨 Intelligent Alerts
The system includes a **Liquidity Check** module. If the shop's Accounts Payable exceeds its Receivable, the system triggers a `SAFETY ALERT`, calculating the exact "Cash Gap" needed to maintain business operations.
