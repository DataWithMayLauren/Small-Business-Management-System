# 🧺 Laundry Logic: Automated Clean
### 🧾 Financial Modules
- **Accounts Receivable (AR):** Automatically tracks unpaid customer orders and calculates expected incoming cash.
- **Accounts Payable (AP):** Monitors business expenses and upcoming bills to manage shop overhead.
- **Cash Flow Analysis:** Provides a "Net Cash Position" to determine the business's current financial health.
### 🚨 Intelligent Alerts
The system includes a **Liquidity Check** module. If the shop's Accounts Payable exceeds its Receivable, the system triggers a `SAFETY ALERT`, calculating the exact "Cash Gap" needed to maintain business operations.
### 🏦 Module: Bank Reconciliation
This professional bookkeeping module compares internal sales records against external bank statements.
- **Automated Verification:** Matches total "Paid" orders against actual bank deposits.
- **Discrepancy Detection:** Flags differences immediately to prevent fraud or accounting errors.
- **Audit Ready:** Ensures that the digital ledger and real-world cash are always in sync.
